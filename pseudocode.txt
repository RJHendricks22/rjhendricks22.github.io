Things to research:

How to keep the paddle on same X axis
Bouncing ball off paddle acting like it starts up again in semi-circle
Collision check, if edges overlap



Code:
Need to generate on load the blocks
Divs, with different colors
Lay out blocks in a grid
Create ball
Create paddle
Bounce around, bounce tutorial
Ball position continuously changing based on a function
Load different backgrounds on start, array of 4


Where the blocks will start:
	top left corner, increment per size of the block
	move down a row after top row is filled
	do this by nested for loop

Collision with rectangle is hard
